Introduction
========================================================

<br>

#### **Welcome to the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB) drought indicators dashboard.**

<br>


This website provides access to drought indices that are used by the Montana Governor's Drought and Water Supply Advisory Committee (Monitoring Sub-Committee). All datasets are calculated daily and can be aggregated by watershed and county boundaries. Much of the underlying data in this dashboard is from the gridMET dataset, for more information see http://doi.org/10.1002/joc.3413. In this document we focus on: 

<br>

  + 1. Providing current drought information using the most current peer reviewed science
  + 2. A description of the theoretical basis for a metric 
  + 3. Data required for calculation of each index
  + 4. Discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of a metric 
  + 5. Validating a metric using on the ground observations (soil moisture, streamflow and groundwater; ongoing)

<br>

This work is supported by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Drought Early Warning System (DEWS). More information on NIDIS and the DEWS program can be found at https://www.drought.gov/drought/what-nidis.

========================================================

### **Montana Mesonet**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

The Montana Climate Office (MCO) is leading the development of a cooperative statewide soil moisture and meteorological information system. It is designed to support decision-making in agriculture, range and forested watershed contexts. This network will add new remote sites and integrate existing cooperator networks to develop the first statewide soil-climate network. No one entity can ensure sustained operation and success of a statewide climate and soil moisture information network. The MCO is embracing a cooperative context that will address a diverse set of information needs.

Standardized Snow Water Equivalent (SNODAS) {data-navmenu="Snowpack" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **Standardized Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) from SNODAS**

<br>

#### **Overview:**
This data set contains estimates of standardized snow pack anomalies based on the depth of snow water equivalent (SWE), from the NOAA National Weather Service's National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). SNODAS is a modeling and data assimilation system developed by NOHRSC to provide the best possible estimates of snow cover and associated parameters to support hydrologic modeling and analysis. Standardization is conducted using a similar framework to computation of the standardized precipitation index (SPI). Negative (red) values represent lesser than average SWE while positive (blue) values represent greater than average SWE. Standardization is based on data from 2004-present and computed daily.

Precipitation Percentiles {data-navmenu="Precipitation" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **Precipitation Percentiles**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

Precipitation is a strong driver of drought. In most cases, drought begins with a precipitation deficit which is the exacerbated by atmospheric conditions (such as temperature, humidity and wind speed). In this module we present precipitation percentiles calculated over timescales ranging from 15 to 365 days. As an example of how to interpret each map, 50 represents the normal (median; white shading) precipitation over a given time period, 100 would be the wettest period on record (dark blue) and 0 would represent the driest conditions observed (dark red). The analysis is conducted over a period from 1979 to present.

<br>

#### **Data Requirements:**

  + Precipitation 

<br>  


##### Select a timescale from the left panel on the map. You can also toggle overlays, such as the current US Drought Monitor (USDM) drought designations, weather (from the National Weather Service) and state boundaries.

<br>

##### Tabs above the map allow you to aggregate the data by political or hydrologic boundaries.

Row {.tabset .tabset-fade}
-------------------------------------

### **Derivation:**
For each timescale we calculate the accumulated precipitation for each year across the period of record (1979 - present) and compute the current percentile value. 

**Key Strengths:**

  + Easy to calculate; uses only precipitation data. 
  + Easy to interpret
  
**Key Weaknesses:** 

  + Sensitive to biases in precipitation records over time
  + Doesn't account for atmospheric demand on moisture (i.e. evapotranspiration), this limits identification of flash droughts due to high temperatures and large vapor pressure deficits
  + Does not account for the capacity of the landscape to store or release moisture (e.g. soil moisture, groundwater and streamflow)
  <br>
  
  
Temperature Percentiles {data-navmenu="Temperature" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **Temperature Percentiles**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

Temperature is a strong mediator of drought. In most cases, precipitation deficits are exacerbated by atmospheric dryness, which is strongly linked to temperature. In this module we present temperature percentiles calculated over timescales ranging from 15 to 365 days. As an example of how to interpret each map, 50 represents the normal (median; white shading) temperature over a given time period, 100 would be the warmest period on record (dark red) and 0 would represent the coldest conditions observed (dark blue). The analysis is conducted over a period from 1979 to present.

  + Easy to interpret
  
**Key Weaknesses:** 

  + Sensitive to biases in temperature records over time

Soil Moisture Percentiles (Modeled) {data-navmenu="Soil Moisture" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **Soil Moisture Percentiles**
#### **National Weather Service, Climate Prediction Center**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

Soil moisture is a strong indicator of drought. In this module we present modeled soil moisture percentiles calculated by the NOAAs Climate Prediction Center. This map is based on an ensemble of the MOSAIC, NOAH, VIC & SAC soil moisture models. The map is derived using a 30 day time scale and is updated every week. As an example of how to read this map, 50 represents the average (median) soil moisture relative to the period from 1980 to 2007. 100 and 0 represent the wettest and driest conditions observed respectively.

NDVI Anomaly {data-navmenu="Vegetation" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **NDVI Anomaly**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a commonly used indicator of ecosystem photosynthesis and provides an indication of vegetation status. Here we present NDVI anomalies computed as a Z-Score. Positive values indicate greener than expected vegetation when compared to the same time period between 2002 – present. These data are provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra Satellite.

<br>

#### **Data Requirements:**

  + NDVI 

<br>  


##### Select a timescale from the left panel on the map. You can also toggle overlays, such as the current US Drought Monitor (USDM) drought designations, weather (from the National Weather Service) and state boundaries.

NDVI Trend {data-navmenu="Vegetation" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **NDVI Trend Through Time**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a commonly used indicator of ecosystem photosynthesis and provides an indication of vegetation status. Here we present NDVI trends computed as a linear trend through time multiplied by the selected timescale. Positive values indicate vegetation that is greening (NDVI increasing), while negative values indicate vegetation that is browning (NDVI decreasing) over the time period selected. These data are provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra Satellite.

<br>

#### **Data Requirements:**

  + NDVI 

<br>  


##### Select a timescale from the left panel on the map. You can also toggle overlays, such as the current US Drought Monitor (USDM) drought designations, weather (from the National Weather Service) and state boundaries.

Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) {data-navmenu="Drought Metrics" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

The SPI is a common metric which quantifies precipitation anomalies at various timescales. SPI is often used to estimate a range of hydrological processes that respond to precipitation from short to long periods of time. For example, SPI is related to soil moisture anomalies when calculated over short time scales (days to weeks) but is more related to groundwater and reservoir storage over longer timescales (months to years). The values of SPI can be interpreted as a number of standard deviations away from the average cumulative precipitation depth for a given time period. The SPI has unique statistical qualities in that it is directly related to precipitation probability and it can be used to represent both dry (negative values; represented here with warmer colors) and wet (positive values; represented here with cooler colors) conditions. 

<br>

#### **Data Requirements:**

  + Precipitation 

<br>  


##### Select a timescale from the left panel on the map. You can also toggle overlays, such as the current US Drought Monitor (USDM) drought designations, weather (from the National Weather Service) and state boundaries.

<br>

##### Tabs above the map allow you to aggregate the data by political or hydrologic boundaries.

Row {.tabset .tabset-fade}
-------------------------------------

### **Derivation:**
The SPI quantifies precipitation as a standardized departure from a probability distribution function that models the raw precipitation data. The raw precipitation data are typically fitted to a gamma or a Pearson Type III distribution, and then transformed to a normal distribution (Keyantash and NCAR staff, 2018). Normalization of data is important because precipitation data is heavily right hand skewed. This is because smaller precipitation events are much more probable than large events. In our calculations we use a gamma distribution.

**Key Strengths:**

  + Easy to calculate; uses only precipitation data
  + Can be used to estimate effects of wet or dry time periods on hydrologic processes (e.g. soil moisture, groundwater, etc) using different time scales
  + Comparable across regions due to normalization of data
  + Can account for changes in climatology because the probability distributions are updated through time
  
**Key Weaknesses:** 

  + Sensitive to biases in precipitation records over time
  + Doesn't account for atmospheric demand of moisture, this limits identification of flash drought due to high temperature and large vapor pressure deficits
  + Does not account for the capacity of the landscape to store or release water (e.g. soil moisture, groundwater and streamflow)
  <br>
  

### **Historical Validation:** 
There has been extensive validation of the SPI across the globe. In general, results have shown that the SPI provides similar results to different standardized precipitation indices.

Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) {data-navmenu="Drought Metrics" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)**

<br>

#### **Overview:**
SPEI takes into account both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration to describe the wetness or dryness of a time period. SPEI can be calculated at various timescales to represent different drought timescales and its impacts on hydrological conditions ranging from short to long timescales. SPEI incorporates the important effect of atmospheric demand on drought. 

<br>

#### **Data Requirements:**

  + Precipitation 
  + Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)

<br>


##### Select a timescale from the left panel on the map. You can also toggle overlays, such as the current US Drought Monitor (USDM) drought designations, weather (from the National Weather Service) and state boundaries.

<br>

##### Tabs above the map allow you to aggregate the data by political or hydrologic boundaries.

Row {.tabset .tabset-fade}
-------------------------------------
### **Derivation:**
SPEI is an extension of the SPI in the sense that it uses a normalized probability distribution approximation of raw values to calculate deviation from normals. Similar to SPI, SPEI values are reported in units of standard deviation or z-score (Vicente-Serrano and NCAR staff, 2015). Although, the raw values for this metric are P-PET. 

**Key Strengths:**

  + Combines information about water availability (precipitation) and atmospheric demand for moisture (potential evapotranspiration)
  + Relatively simple to calculate and only requires climatological data and statistical models
  + Does not incorporate assumptions about the behavior of the underlying system
  + Can be calculated where only T and P exist (if using Thornthwaite based PET)
  + Can be calculated with more sophisticated PET algorithms if data is available 

**Key Weaknesses:** 

  + Sensitive to differences in PET calculations 
  + Requires climatology of data to have accurate statistical reference distributions
  + Sensitive to probability distribution used to normalize data distribution
  
### **Historical Validation:**
The SPEI has been used in many studies to understand the effects of drought on hydrologic resource availability, including reservoir, stream discharge and groundwater. In general, SPEI calculated at longer timescales (>12 months) has shown greater correlation with water levels in lakes and reservoirs (McEvoy et al., 2012).

Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI) {data-navmenu="Drought Metrics" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **Evaporative Demand Drought Index (EDDI)**

<br>

#### **Overview:**
EDDI calculates the rank of accumulated PET for a given region. EDDI does not standardize data based off of theoretical (parameterized) probability distributions (such as SPI and SPEI). Instead, EDDI uses a non-parametric approach to compute empirical probabilities using inverse normal approximation. This method calculates EDDI by ranking the data from smallest to largest and accounting for the number of observations. Therefore, maximum and minimum values of EDDI are constrained by the number of years on record (which determines the number of observations). Practically, this causes EDDI to show the relative ranking of year, with respect to the period of record. 
<br>

#### **Data Requirements:**

  + Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)

<br>


##### Select a timescale from the left panel on the map. You can also toggle overlays, such as the current US Drought Monitor (USDM) drought designations, weather (from the National Weather Service) and state boundaries.

<br>

##### Tabs above the map allow you to aggregate the data by political or hydrologic boundaries.

GRACE Shallow Groundwater (Modeled) {data-navmenu="Drought Metrics" data-icon="fa-list" data-orientation=rows}
========================================================
### **GRACE Shallow Groundwater Drought Indicator**
#### **NASA Goddard Space Flight Center**

<br>

#### **Overview:**

This groundwater drought indicator is based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE-FO satellite data which is then integrated with other observations, using a land surface water and energy model. The drought indicators describe current wet or dry conditions, expressed as a percentile showing the probability of occurrence for that particular location and time of year, with lower values (warm colors) meaning dryer than normal, and higher values (blues) meaning wetter than normal.
