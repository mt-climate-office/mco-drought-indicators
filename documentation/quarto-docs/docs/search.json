    "text": "As described by the American Meteorological Society, drought is defined as “A period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance.” Droughts can be characterized in terms of their severity, location, duration and timing. They arise from a range of hydrometeorological processes that suppress precipitation, enhance evaporative water loss and contribute to declines in soil moisture, surface water or groundwater availability. In turn, these declines lead to conditions that are significantly drier than normal and that have serious impacts to important sectors across the world.\nDrought intensity is characterized according to how much moisture is expected in a given location and/or time period. This important concept means that drought is relative and dependent on the base-line reference conditions against which today’s conditions are compared. For example, a missing inch of precipitation may be of no concern to communities on the coast where precipitation is abundant, but may have catastrophic implications for communities in more arid regions."

    "text": "Types of Drought\nWhile somewhat technical, there are five types of drought that are generally thought to occur. These drought types include:\n\nMeteorological Drought: When dry weather patterns dominate an area.\nHydrological Drought: When low water supply becomes evident in the water system.\nAgricultural Drought: When crops become affected by drought.\nSocioeconomic Drought: When the supply and demand of various commodities is affected by drought.\nEcological Drought: When natural ecosystems are affected by drought.\n\nAlthough these types of droughts have been identified, they do not occur in isolation from one another. For example, meteorological drought is a primary driver of other forms of drought, such as hydrological and agricultural drought."

    "text": "One of the primary forms of drought is meteorological drought. Therefore, having a strong understanding of meteorological events and anomalies is a critical consideration in drought monitoring. The core meteorological data set used in the UMRB Drought Dashboard is gridMet. gridMET is a gridded (spatial) dataset that provides estimates of meteorological conditions such as precipitation, temperature, wind speed, reference evapotranspiration, etc. As described by the authors of gridMET:\n“gridMET blends spatial attributes of gridded climate data from PRISM with desirable temporal attributes (and additional variables) from regional reanalysis (NLDAS-2) using climatically aided interpolation. The resulting product is a spatially and temporally complete, high-resolution (1/24th degree ~4-km) gridded data set of surface meteorological variables.”\ngridMET was chosen as the primary meteorological data set for the UMRB Drought Dashboard for a few key reasons. Firstly, it reliably provides data at a daily time step with low latency (~2 days, e.g. the lag before data is available to process). This means that data is available quickly for use in drought assessment, aiding in the rapid evaluation of quickly changing conditions. Secondly, it provides data at an appropriate spatial resolution (~4km) for operational drought monitoring. Because drought monitoring is conducted at regional spatial scales, 4km data provides more that proficient spatial detail and wall-to-wall coverage across the domain. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, gridMET provides the lowest bias and mean absolute error when compared to alternative gridded data sets of similar nature to the MT Mesonet, an independent observational data set. This analysis is currently being formalized and will be appended to this document upon completion.\nMore information on gridMET can be found here.\nCitation: Abatzoglou, J. T. (2013), Development of gridded surface meteorological data for ecological applications and modelling. Int. J. Climatol., 33: 121–131.\n\n\n\n\nEstimates of snow pack accumulation and melt are critical information to assess winter time water storage scross the UMRB. One dataset used within the UMRB Drought Dashboard to describe snow water equivalent (SWE) is provided by the NOAA National Weather Service’s National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). SNODAS is a modeling and data assimilation system developed by NOHRSC to provide the best possible estimates of snow cover and associated parameters to support hydrologic modeling and analysis.\nMore information on SNODAS can be found here.\nCitation: National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center. 2004.

NSIDC: National Snow and Ice Data Center. doi: https://doi.org/10.7265/N5TB14TC. [Date Accessed].\n\n\n\n\nThe Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission (run by NASA) is a satellite that measures the amount of water in the surface soil everywhere on Earth. SMAP is designed to measure soil moisture every 2-3 days providing a critical source of information to assess regional soil moisture conditions. The UMRB drought dashboard uses SMAP Level 3 soil moisture observations which have been integrated into a modified two-layer Palmer model using a 1-D Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation approach. This allows for the evaluation of surface and subsurface soil moisture conditions across the UMRB.\nMore information on SMAP can be found here (NASA official page) and here (data access page).\n\n\n\n\nGroundwater anomalies are a key drought indicator, especially when considering long timescales and deep moisture reservoirs often utilized in agriculture. However, groundwater is notoriously difficult to measure and when observed (using wells for example), often only represents conditions at a local point. To aid in measuring groundwater dynamics across the globe, NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) program was launched to accurately map variations in Earth’s gravity field. These observations of gravity provide observations of variations of mass associated with runoff and ground water storage on land masses. Here, we use a GRACE informed indicator of groundwater availability based on terrestrial water storage observations derived from GRACE-FO satellite data which is then integrated with other observations, using a land surface water and energy model.\nMore information on GRACE can be found here and more information on the GRACE based groundwater drought indicator can be found here.\n\n\n\n\nMODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites run by NASA. The MODIS sensors are sensitive to biologically relevant light reflections that allow for the estimation of vegetation growth, health and drought response. One of the key data sets derived from the MODIS sensors is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI is a commonly used indicator of ecosystem photosynthesis and provides an indication of vegetation status. Alternative vegetation indicies (such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI) are also available from MODIS. MODIS data is used in the UMRB drought dashboard to provide regional information on vegetation drought response and ecosystem drought conditions.\nMore information on the MODIS sensors can be found here and more information on the specific dataset used within the UMRB drought dashboard can be found here."

    "text": "Climate change is impacting water supplies for communities and ecosystems around the world. Several regions of North America are experiencing decreases in annual rainfall, shifts in the seasonality of precipitation, and an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events. A lack of rainfall can contribute to anomalously dry conditions, leading to cascading water deficits across the entire hydrological system. Therefore, rainfall deficits play an important role in determining where and when drought is occurring. Drought intensity is characterized according to how much moisture is expected in a given location and/or time period. This important concept means that drought is relative and dependent on the base-line reference conditions against which today’s conditions are compared. For example, a missing inch of precipitation may be of no concern to communities on the coast where precipitation is abundant, but may have catastrophic implications for communities in more arid regions.\n Figure 1: Conceptual model describing the drought metric bias associated with a non-stationary climate scenario. A theoretical accumulated precipitation dataset is presented on the horizontal axis, while the associated probability density function (PDF) is on the vertical axis. [left] Conceptual model showing one way probability distributions can shift in time when conditions transition from a wetter less variable state to a drier more variable state.

    "text": "2.2 Shorter Climatology Lengths Capture Current Climate\nIn an era of rapidly changing climate conditions, shorter reference frames (e.g. climatology lengths) more appropriately describe current climate conditions. Therefore, a more recent and contemporary reference frame better describes current day drought risk and event severity. The UMRB Drought Dashboard follows this important consideration and utilizes a 30-year moving window approach to describe current drought conditions. This 30-year moving window is updated every year as new data is available. As is described in Hoylman et al., 2022, a 30-year reference frame is well suited to balance the statistical constraints on computing drought metrics while maintaining a contemporary perspective on drought severity."
